# Roberto-DFE-Project

This is Roberto Jr Mapaye's Project. This will focus on the knowledge I have learned throughout the QA Academy Bootcamp as I create an Esports Team tracker. This Esports team tracker will showcase the players and what team they are a part of. 

This project will showcase the CRUD functionality, The relationships between two tables (Players and Teams), the usage of a frontend and backend, CI/CD and Testing.
